# STQS

## Requirements

NodeJS 18+
NPM

## Running

`npm ci`
`npm run dev`
See `package.json` for more details on available scripts.

## Exercise

Run the project (or read `./src/App.tsx`) for details of the exercise.

## Notes

I have focused on the account creation and account system.

Application gets rendered twice on first init, this is because of React strict mode.

I have never used Vi before have probably used some things wrong. It's very close to jest hopefully it should be mostly ok.
